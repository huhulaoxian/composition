Images are used for photographic composition classification.
The ground truth labels are described in the ground truth files: 'test_label.txt' and 'train_label.txt'.
In the files, a binary row represent the ground truth information of an image, where corresponding composition labels are set 1, otherwise 0.
The order of composition rules are as follows:
rule of thirds(RoT), vertical, horizontal, diagonal, curved, triangle, center, symmetric, pattern.
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
horizontal, symmetric, rule of thirds(RoT), vertical, triangle, diagonal, center, curved, pattern.
2,7,0,1,5,3,6,4,8
